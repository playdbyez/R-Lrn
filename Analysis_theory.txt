					$? Symbolic Reasoning $?
					(Logic & Philosophy)

Deduction dictates narrowing that:
if a tree is  green,
and green trees are alive,
then tree is alive.
( if A=1 and 1A=X then A=X )


Induction dictates broadning that:
if a tree is green,
and the tree is alive
then green tree is alive
( if A=1 and A=X then 1A=X )

 -Deduction = Engineering reasoning
 +Induction = Scientific reasoning





				$? Neural Connectionist $?
				(Backwards Propagation of Errors)

Using backpropagation to determine under which conditions, 
errors from networks built to resamble human neurons are removed

This is achieved by changing weights and biases of the network until the actual output matches the target output.

Passing the solution to the next neuron in the line , 
various neurons work in paralel by solving a small part of the problem until the group creates a final output solution.
 
 @Weights = how much an input figures-In in the result.
 @Biases = which features are selected.




 
				$? Evolutionary variation $?
				(Genetic Programming)

Using a true structure like a fitness method to determine,
the most viable solution by removing solutions that do not match the desired output.

survival of the fittest the winner of each level gets clser to solving the problem by building upon the next of solutions.

				$? Bayesian inference $?
				(Statistics)

Seeks to determine the probability of a certain output based on subjective inputs.


example inputs = cough,sore throat
example outputs = 50%flu? ,15%cold? ,5%allergy? ,15%covid ,10%H1N1 ,5%more options?

				$? Analog learning $?
 				(Psychology)

Uses kernel machines to recgnise patterns in data,
by comparing the pattern of a known output to aset of inputs,
with the goal to use similarity to determine if a solution worked before,then
using it again for a similar set of circumstances should also work as output.
